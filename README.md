**SpatialRay** is an open sourced raytraced rendering engine. Based on the BRDF reflectance model, it produces photolike outputs of complex scenes loaded via the GLTF file format.

## About the project
This was an educational project I took on in 2023 to further refine my skills in C++, and to pursue my interest in simulation. As such, this project is composed entirely of my own code, with the exception of the standard library, SFML (a basic graphics lib) and tinyGLTF (a gltf file parser)
